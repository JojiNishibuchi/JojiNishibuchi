Hello, my name is Joji Nishibuchi. I am currently an undergraduate student in Materials Science and Engineering at Purdue University 
intending to continue my studies into a Master's in Materials Engineering, focusing on computational simulations of materials. This GitHub page is intended to serve
as a small portfolio of my personal projects outside of my research and coursework. 

My main languages:
  - JavaScript
  - Python
  - MATLAB
